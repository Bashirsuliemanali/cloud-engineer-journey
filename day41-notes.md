# Day 41 – Portfolio Project Foundations

Defining structure before writing code is important because it shows intent and direction early. Strong foundations make projects easier to scale, understand, and maintain over time. Without structure, systems become fragile and harder to work with as they grow.

This project differs from a basic EC2 demo because it is designed in a production style way. It focuses on using the right tools at the right time, with safety, sustainability, and predictability as priorities rather than just getting infrastructure running.

The project demonstrates real world team workflows, including the use of remote state with S3 and DynamoDB. It also shows how clear structure supports collaboration, helps teams understand what they are working on, and keeps everyone aligned when managing shared infrastructure.
