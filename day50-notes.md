# Day 50 — Portfolio Consolidation & Milestone Reflection

Today marked a major milestone in my journey: 50 days of structured learning and consistent execution.

Rather than adding new infrastructure, I focused on consolidating and polishing the Terraform Web Service project into a portfolio ready state.

## What I Improved
	-	Cleaned and refined the README for clarity and professionalism.
	-	Clearly documented architecture flow and infrastructure components.
	-	Highlighted production-style elements:
	-	Custom VPC (not default)
	-	Multi-AZ design
	-	ALB + Target Group
	-	Auto Scaling Group
	-	Remote state (S3 + DynamoDB locking)
	-	CloudWatch alarms
	-	Clarified IAM & least privilege mindset.

## Key Realisation

This project is no longer a tutorial exercise.

It demonstrates:
	- Structured infrastructure design
	-	Safe Terraform workflows
	-	Observability thinking
	-	Scaling and high availability concepts
	-	Discipline around cost and destruction

Fifty days ago I was learning fundamentals.

Today I can calmly explain:
	-	State & locking
	-	Drift
	-	Load balancing
	-	Auto scaling
	-	Health checks
	-	Blast radius considerations

The focus is no longer just building infrastructure, it is understanding architecture and communicating it clearly.
