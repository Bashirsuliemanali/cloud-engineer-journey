# Day 21 – Explaining My Terraform Setup Clearly

Today I focused on being able to explain my Terraform project clearly without relying on code.

I practised breaking down my setup in simple terms, explaining what the infrastructure does, why I chose Terraform, and how the workflow stays safe using plan, apply, and destroy.

This helped me realise that understanding isn’t just about writing configuration files, but also being able to communicate decisions and trade-offs confidently, especially in interviews or when working in a team.

By the end of today, I feel more comfortable explaining my infrastructure end-to-end and answering basic follow-up questions without freezing.
