# Day 1 - Cloud fundamentals 

# what is cloud computing?
cloud computing is ability to have data centres and servers digitially without needed to physically own anything but have the abitilty to use them at your will and only pay for the services you actually use so it doesnt take up space phyically and doesnt cost as much as a data centre for example. 

## On-Prem vs Cloud 
- On-Prem: This is having actual phyical servers which you manage on your own so if things go down you fix it takes up a lot of power and man power also to maintain. 
- Cloud: This is having the servers and centres digitally and your only get what you need and pay for what you use depending on what services you use the cloud provider maintains and manages it for you.m

## One benefit that stood out to me 
i think id mention 2 the cost because not everyone can afford to pay for a data centre and have massive servers and b. it helps you grow geographically too and not have any latency issues which is a big key in 2025. 

## One real life example
Online gaming something i did a lot playing fifa or COD in order for me to to play especially againsts people not in the country i am you need cloud computing to connect and make sure everyone has a good connection otherwise  a guy playing againt me in germany wont have a good connection as someone playing me in london. Also the traffic weekends are way more busier so they can increase and decrease capacity to cope with hot times.
