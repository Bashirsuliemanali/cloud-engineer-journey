# Day 32 – Python for DevOps Basics

Today I was introduced to Python from a DevOps perspective. The focus was not on becoming a software engineer, but on understanding why Python is widely used to automate tasks and glue tools together.

I ran a simple Python script to confirm my environment was set up correctly and saw how quick and lightweight Python is to work with.

The key takeaway is that Python in DevOps is about usefulness and automation, not complex programming.
