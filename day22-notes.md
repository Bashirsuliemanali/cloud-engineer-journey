# Day 22 – Team-Safe Terraform Variables

Today I focused on cleaning up my Terraform variables to make the project safer and easier for others to use.

I clarified the purpose and types of the root variables so that anyone running the Terraform code would understand what each input controls. I also learned the difference between root variables, which act as the interface for users, and module variables, which handle internal implementation details.

This helped me understand how teams structure Terraform projects to reduce mistakes and make infrastructure changes safer.
