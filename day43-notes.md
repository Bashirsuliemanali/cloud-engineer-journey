## Day 43 – Making the Project Portfolio Ready 

# Why does clean documentation matter more than adding new infrastructure?

Because infrastructure that works but isn’t explained properly can’t be trusted by other engineers. Clean documentation shows intent, discipline, and understanding. Adding more services doesn’t add value if no one understands how or why the system exists.

# How does this README help someone trust your Terraform work?

It clearly explains what the project does, how it’s structured, and how to run it safely. Anyone reading it can see that the workflow is intentional, uses remote state and locking, and follows plan/apply discipline. This reduces guesswork and shows that the infrastructure is not experimental or careless.

# Why is boring, clear structure a strength in real teams?

Because real production systems need to be predictable and safe, not impressive. Boring structure means fewer surprises, easier reviews, and less risk. Teams value stability and clarity more than complexity, especially when multiple people are working on the same infrastructure.

# What habit is reinforced on Day 43?

Finishing work properly. Not rushing to add more features, but making sure what already exists is clean, readable, and ready to be understood by others. This is how trust is built in real engineering teams.
