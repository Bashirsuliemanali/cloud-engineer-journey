# Day 19 – Making the GitHub Repo Clear 

Today I focused on improving the presentation of my GitHub repository rather than building new infrastructure.

I added a root README to clearly explain what this project is about, what I’ve built so far, and the tools I’m using. The goal was to make it easy for someone to understand my work within a short amount of time without clicking through lots of files.

This made me realise that building things is only part of the job. Being able to explain and present your work clearly is just as important, especially when applying for roles.

By the end of today, my repo feels more organised, more professional, and easier for others to understand.
