# Day 31 – Terraform in Real Team Workflows

Today I focused on understanding Terraform as part of a real team workflow rather than a solo tool. The process involves formatting, validating, planning, reviewing, and only then applying changes.

I reinforced the idea that terraform apply should be a guarded and deliberate action, not something rushed. Reviewing the plan is just as important as reviewing the code itself.

The main lesson today is that safe infrastructure changes depend more on discipline and process than speed.
